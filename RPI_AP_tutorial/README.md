# Setting up an Access Point on Raspberry PI #
In this tutorial we will set up a Raspberry Pi as an IOT Gateway
## Purpose ##
An IOT accesspoint allows IOT devices to connect to the local wireless network. the gateway has the additonal capablity of routing the IOT data to the internet.
So the purpose of this tutorial is to set a Raspberry Pi as the access point and gateway.
1. Install a version of a Linux operating system on the PI
2. Setup the wireless accesspoint to allow both the IOT devices and our laptop to connect to the PI
3. Setup the ethernet and router to all the PI act as gateway
4. Test that you can connect to the weatherapi as setup in the wifi_tutorial both with you laptop and your arduino
## Setup ##
What you will need for this tutorial:
1. A laptop or desktop to act as your development platform
2. A Raspberry PI ( 3 B+ or 4 )
3. A Class 10 microSD 8gb or better (max 32gb) https://www.mymemory.co.uk/blog/the-best-memory-cards-for-raspberry-pi/
4. Ethernet cable
5. Ethernet router

## Tutorial Steps ##
### 1. Setup your working environment on your laptop ###

### 2. Download and configure  DietPI on your laptop

### 3. Copy the Configured DietPI image to your PI SD card

### 4. Install and run DietPI on your PI

### 5. Login to the DietPi using the wireless access point

### 6. Setup ethernet and router on the PI

### 7. Test the internet connection using openweathermap api
